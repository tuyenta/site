										<h2>Game Theory</h2>
									</header>



									<p> My research focuses on the application of game theory for the security problem in the Cognitive Radio (CR) networks, which is a key candidate for the future wireless communications. In such model, the network operation is under control of a central entity, referred as the network coordinator. To mitigate the influence of the misbehaving users (or refers to Attacker) to the operation of the network, we propose a surveillance process, implemented by the network coordinator (or refers to Defender). The interaction between Defender and Attacker, like the avoid fare evasion or the patrolling scenarios, can be seen as the model of leadership and commitment and formulated by the Stackelberg game. Our work then characterizes the corresponding attack and surveillance strategies of Attacker and Defender through the Strong Stackelberg Equilibrium (SSE) through the Multiple Linear Program method. A comparison to the conventional surveillance game with NE strategy shows that Defender should exploit the leader position in the game by committing to a defense strategy. </p>
									<p> I see this work as the starting point for my long-term research goal of extending the field of application of game theory and machine learning, particularly Reinforcement Learning (RL), for security, economy, and communication networks. My future research projects include a study of the stochastic game for the security problem in the next-generation wireless communication under the attack of misbehaving users, as well as a project exploring the game theory-based collaborative framework to maintain a harmonized coexistence between communication systems. The goal is to create a new communication paradigm that communications systems can work together and individually with each other through autonomy. Also, I look forward to enriching my knowledge on game theory and machine learning by exploring the application of the Stackelberg game and the stochastic model in the security and economics scenario with single leader multiple followers and multiple leaders multiple followers.</p>

										<h2>Machine Learning</h2>

									<p> Deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) has been developed for a wide range of applications such as image recognition, nature language processing, etc. However, the deployment of deep CNNs in home and mobile devices remains challenging due to substantial requirements for computing resources and energy needed for the computation of high-dimensional convolutions. In this paper, we propose a novel approach designed to minimize energy consumption in the computation of convolutions in deep CNNs. The proposed solution includes (i) an optimal selection method for Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) configuration associated with splitting input feature maps, (ii) a reconfigurable hardware architecture for computing high-dimensional convolutions based on 2D-FFT, and (iii) an optimal pipeline data movement scheduling. The FFT size selecting method enables us to determine the optimal length of the split input for the lowest energy consumption. The hardware architecture contains a processing engine (PE) array, whose PEs are connected to form parallel flexible-length Radix-2 single-delay feedback lines, enabling the computation of variable-size 2D-FFT. The pipeline data movement scheduling optimizes the transition between row-wise FFT and column-wise FFT in a 2D-FFT process and minimizes the required data access for the element-wise accumulation across input channels. Using simulations, we demonstrated that the proposed framework improves the energy consumption by 89.7% in the inference case.</p>
